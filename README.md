# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Project

In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of electric vehicle data using **Tableau** software. The result is a comprehensive interactive dashboard that provides insights into the electric vehicle market.

## Project Overview

In front of you is a fully interactive dashboard that features multiple filters and action filters, allowing for in-depth exploration of the data. This dashboard is created using Tableau software, and the data used is available for download in the links below.

### Final Dashboard Output

## Key Features

- **Interactive Elements**: The dashboard includes several elements that make it user-friendly. Users can filter data by different parameters, such as model, state, and electric vehicle type, enabling dynamic analysis.
  
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: At the top of the dashboard, key metrics are displayed, such as:
  - Total Vehicles
  - Electric Range
  - Total BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles)
  - Total PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles)

- **Data Visualization**: Various charts display the number of electric vehicle registrations by model, the availability of vehicles by location, and the top 10 vehicles by manufacturer.

- **Action Filters**: The dashboard allows users to click on specific models or states to see filtered results. For example, selecting "Tesla" shows all related data for Tesla vehicles.
